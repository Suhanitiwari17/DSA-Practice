You are given an unsorted array of integers and an integer x. Your task is to
 determine the first and last positions where x appears in the array.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T (number of test cases).
Each test case consists of two lines:
The first line contains two integers: N (size of the array) and x (the element to search for).
The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the array elements.

Constraints
1≤T≤100 (number of test cases)
1≤N≤10^5(size of the array)

Output Format
For each test case, print two integers: the first and last occurrence (0-based index) of x. 
If x is not found, print "−1 −1"
