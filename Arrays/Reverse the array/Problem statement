Given an array/list 'ARR' of integers and a position ‘M’. You have to reverse the array after that position.

Example:

We have an array ARR = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and M = 3 , considering 0 
based indexing so the subarray {5, 6} will be reversed and our 
output array will be {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5}.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
0 <= M <= N <= 5*10^4
-10^9 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9
