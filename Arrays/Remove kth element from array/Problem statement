Given an array A of size N and an integer i, where 0 <= i < N, the task is to remove the element at the i-th index from the array A. The resulting array should contain N-1 elements, with the order of the remaining elements preserved.

Input:
An array A (e.g., A = [element_0, element_1, ..., element_N-1])
An integer i representing the index of the element to be removed.

Output:
A modified array A with the element at index i removed, and the remaining elements shifted to maintain contiguity.

Constraints:
The index i must be a valid index within the array's bounds (i.e., 0 <= i < N).
The array A can be empty or contain one or more elements
