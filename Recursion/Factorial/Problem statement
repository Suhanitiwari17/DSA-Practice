A single non-negative integer, n.
Output:
The factorial of n, denoted as n!, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. If n is 0, the factorial is defined as 1. If n is a negative integer, the program should indicate that the factorial is undefined for such input.
Example:
Input: 5
Output: 120 (since 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
Input: 0
Output: 1 (since 0! = 1 by definition)
Input: -3
Output: Factorial is undefined for negative numbers. (or a similar error message)
