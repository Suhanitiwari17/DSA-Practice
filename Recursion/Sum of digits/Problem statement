A single integer N. This integer can be positive, negative, or zero. For negative numbers, the sum of digits should be calculated as if the number were positive (i.e., the absolute value of the number).
Output:
An integer representing the sum of the digits of N. 
Examples:
Input: N = 123
Output: 6 (because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6)

Input: N = 407
Output: 11 (because 4 + 0 + 7 = 11)

Input: N = -58
Output: 13 (because |-58| = 58, and 5 + 8 = 13)

Input: N = 0
Output: 0 (because the sum of digits of 0 is 0)
