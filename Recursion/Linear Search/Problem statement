Given an array or list of N elements and a target element X, determine if X is present in the array. 
If X is found, return the index of its first occurrence within the array. 
If X is not found after searching through all elements, return a value indicating its absence (e.g., -1).          

Input:     
An array/list of elements, arr, of size \(N\). A target element, X, to be searched within arr.  

arr = [5, 2, 10, 4, 6]
X = 10

Output:     
The 0-based index of the first occurrence of X in arr if X is found. -1 if X is not present in arr.
