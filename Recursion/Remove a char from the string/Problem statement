Given a string s and a character c, write a recursive function to return a new string where all occurrences of character c have been removed from s.
Input: s: The input string and c: The character to be removed.

Output:
A new string with all occurrences of c removed.

Constraints:
The input string s can be empty.
The character c can be any valid character.

Examples:
Code
removeChar("hello", 'l')  -> "heo"
removeChar("programming", 'g') -> "prorammine"
removeChar("apple", 'p') -> "ale"
