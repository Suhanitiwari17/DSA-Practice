Given a non-negative integer n, determine whether it is odd. Return true if the number is odd, otherwise return false. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., n % 2 != 0).

Examples
Example 1:
Input: n = 7
Output: true
Explanation: 7 is not divisible by 2. Hence, it is odd.

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: false
Explanation: 10 is divisible by 2. Hence, it is not odd.
