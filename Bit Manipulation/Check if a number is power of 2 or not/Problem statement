Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false. An integer n is a power of two if there exists an integer x such that n == 2ˣ.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 2⁴ = 16, so 16 is a power of two.

Example 2: 
Input: n = 3
Output: false
Explanation: 3 is not a power of two.
